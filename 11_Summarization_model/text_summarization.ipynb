It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

      "\n",
      "He then outlines 10 key messages that he has learned during his interactions with people from various walks of life, including politics, science, academia, art, literature, business, and youth. These messages include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development, which is driven by the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",

      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India cannot become a developed nation by 2020. He assures her that it is a thoughtful question and that he will work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering the youth and villages in India. The speaker, who is likely the President of India at the time, mentions that the desire to live in a developed India has become a common aspiration among the youth, with over 15 lakh young people expressing this desire. The speaker suggests that this aspiration should be the guiding factor in professional contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the importance of empowering villages, referring to a specific visit to a village in Nagaland where the speaker saw a village council functioning effectively with financial powers. The speaker notes that if all 600,000 villages in India are empowered to deal with their development and are well-connected with urban societies, it can lead to significant transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speech mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) complex, which involves 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities leading to economic connectivity, and has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district, which aims to promote sustainable economic development in rural areas. The project has achieved significant results, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Developing 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land\n",
      "* Creating employment opportunities for villagers through various activities such as cultivation, processing, and marketing of products\n",
      "* Establishing 1000 self-help groups to support entrepreneurship\n",
      "* Developing innovative products with the support of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women\n",
      "* Enhancing the innovative ability of people in 65 villages, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of similar projects across the country, stating that approximately 7000 PURAs are needed to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two personal experiences that left a lasting impression on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first experience is about meeting over 6,000 farmers from across India at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They also expressed confidence in the nation's ability to increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is about meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who was born without hands and legs, but was radiating happiness and confidence. Despite his physical limitations, he was full of gratitude and asked the speaker what they could do for him. He replied that he would like to sing in front of them, demonstrating his resilience and positivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two personal experiences that highlight the power of resilience and determination. Firstly, they share a story about a person with a physical challenge who was inspired by their parents, teachers, and others to pursue their passion for music. Despite their disability, the person was able to showcase their talent and even perform at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre. The speaker uses this story to illustrate how positive attitude and perseverance can help individuals overcome their challenges and achieve their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker talks about their experience visiting Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage and loss, the speaker was inspired by the courage and resilience of the villagers, who were determined to rebuild their lives and community. The speaker praises the villagers for not allowing their problems to become their masters, but instead taking control of their situation and working together to overcome their challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker describes their experiences visiting areas affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis. They recall visiting a village where children and villagers bravely participated in relief operations with the Armed Forces, despite the challenges they faced. The speaker also shares a personal experience from 2005, where they visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami. They were touched by the resilience and courage of the islanders, who had taken in those affected as their own and did not have the concept of orphanages. The speaker even composed a poem, \"Sea Waves\", which was sung by the villagers, exhibiting their courage and enthusiasm. The speech also mentions a later address to the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, where the speaker emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a high-speed internet network connecting 53 African countries at a cost of $100 million. The network will include connections to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "* 53 tele-education centers\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, which includes a tele-education program for 34 students from Addis Ababa and Harmaya Universities, and a tele-medicine program with specialists from CARE Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two main points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker is proud of the collaboration between India and Africa, where Indian experience in technology has enabled societal transformation in the African continent. Specifically, they mention the tele-consultation service provided by Hyderabad to doctors in Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa.\n",
      "2. The speaker expresses pride in India's Defence Forces, recognizing their bravery, commitment, and dedication to duty. They mention their experiences visiting various military installations, including the Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and a Sukhoi-30 fighter jet. They also acknowledge the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in maintaining the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the \"Youth movement for Developed India 2020\" initiative, where the speaker met a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working to transform youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is talking about the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program that aims to transform young people into enlightened citizens. The program, which was founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, is training thousands of students in various districts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the local administration. The speaker shares examples of the positive impact the program has had on students, such as increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker also shares a personal story of a student leader who was inspired by the program to help her father quit smoking. The speaker believes that the program is empowering the youth of India and that they have the potential to be a powerful resource for the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization for future generations. The speaker highlights the country's progress in the last 60 years and its potential to become a developed nation by 2020. They encourage individuals to strive to empower each other and work towards achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines five distinctive profiles for a developed India, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution of energy and access to quality water\n",
      "3. Harmony between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education with value systems accessible to all, regardless of societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "5. India becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes by emphasizing the importance of working together to achieve these goals, with a quote from a famous poem about making one's dreams come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a ideal nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to all\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* The society is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the last five years.
