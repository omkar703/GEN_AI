      "ANSWER: \"It is not explicitly stated in the context how many total weeks are needed to complete the entire AI Engineer roadmap, as it may vary depending on the individual's pace and learning abilities. However, the total duration mentioned is 8 months, assuming a 6-day study week with 4 hours of study per day. This would roughly translate to 24 weeks. However, it is important to note that this duration is just a guideline and may vary for each individual. Additionally, the roadmap also suggests completing a few weeks of research before starting the actual learning journey. Therefore, the total number of weeks required may be more than 24.\"\n",
